## Customers design — and buy! — personalized products from your store

You’ve heard about product customization. It’s the store owner dream come true! But when you try and launch it for your store, those dreams come crashing down:

-   Hundreds of emails with customization requests flood your inbox

-   People send files that are not ready for print

-   Customers get frustrated when products don’t look how they wanted


Instead of ka-ching! the only thing you hear is ka-boom! as your store implodes before you even get to launch it.

Unless you try Zakeke Interactive Product Designer for WooCommerce.


### Zakeke Interactive Product Designer makes product personalization easy

Just follow these steps:

1.  Install Zakeke Interactive Product Designer in your store

2.  Create your inventory of customizable products

3.  Publish your products live

4.  Get happy customers buying from you… and coming back for more


Zakeke Interactive Product Designer lets customers personalize any product (clothing, promotional gifts, paper products, shoes, jewelry, watches) and visualize how they’ll look before checking out.

You’ll never have to prepare proofs again or hear back from angry customers complaining “this isn’t what it’s supposed to look like”. Customers always know what they are going to get before buying, which means fewer refunds, fewer complaints, and more 5-star ratings.

PLAYMORE TCG
I just wanted to give feedback on what an excellent product and service you have provided my business! Zakeke product designer is a miracle and magical!! you have taken so much stress and frustration out from the hassle of using plugins that just don’t work. Most have the processing on the server the plugin is hosted on but having the chance to use a service like this is a major change and certainly a breakthrough for this industry! When I first set it up was easy and super functional. Your team is incredible and I really truly appreciate the quality work you put into this software thanks!

★★★★
ENGRAVOLOGIST LLC
We searched high and low for a customize product plugin that worked well on both mobile and desktop and THIS IS IT! Most product designers work great on desktop, but really struggle on mobile. The Zakeke product designer on mobile looks just like an app – it’s amazing.

★★★★
STATUS MUGS

★★★★
YOUR BREW
The real reason why I’m switching several of my stores over to this? The price. It is priced fairly and in a manner that they want you to grow and succeed. They aren’t just trying to recoup their money, they see a long term investment in your functioning business as the better option than large outlandish fees. Massively impressed with this app, I would recommend anyone who is currently using another personalisation app sets aside an hour to test this out – It’s all you'll need!

I genuinely want these guys to become the biggest custom product app because they've done such a good job.
